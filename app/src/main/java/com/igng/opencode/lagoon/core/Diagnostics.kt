 * Deliberately never logs credentials, cookies, tokens or message/file content: callers pass only a
 * short reason and the throwable. Crash reporting is intentionally not wired here (it needs an
 * external backend and would introduce a new dependency/secret), so this is the baseline that makes
 * field failures diagnosable via `adb logcat`.
